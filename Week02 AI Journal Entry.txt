AI Usage Journal

Week 2 (INST326)
This week I used AI mainly while working on my INST326 Python exercises. For example, when I was completing my Jupyter notebook, I asked AI to explain why input() returns a string by default and how to properly convert it using int(). That made it easier for me to apply the concept directly in my code.
I also used AI to review how f-strings work and to give me simple examples for formatting output. This was useful when writing code that needed clear print statements.
In addition, I used AI as a tutor for debugging and double-checking logic in my exercises. For instance, I asked it to walk me through vector operations and condition checks in Python so I could understand the reasoning, not just the answer. I then applied those explanations while finishing the notebook on my own.
Here are some of my AI chat links from this week:

Overall, AI was most helpful this week for clarifying concepts and giving quick examples while I worked through the notebook. It didn’t do the assignments for me, but it supported me in learning and completing the work on my own.

week 3

This week I worked on the INST326 Week 3 function exercises. I mostly solved the problems on my own, but I used AI in a few places where I was stuck:
I asked for explanations of function basics like how to return values and how default parameters work.
I had it show me simple examples of string methods (.strip(), .title(), .lower()) so I could apply them to my own code.
When one of my early functions didn’t run, I used AI for debugging help — it pointed out that I had a missing return statement.
I made sure to write the actual solutions myself and just used AI to clear up small questions and double-check my logic.

Week 4

This week I used AI a few times while working on week 04_exercises.ipynb. I was stuck on some small details in my class implementations. For example,
I asked how to decide between using a regular method and a @property for borrowed_count in the Member class. I also asked about why my Shelf.add_title() method was returning None instead of True/False, which helped me realize I needed to explicitly return the values. 
Another time I asked for guidance on how to handle the BookCopy.checkin() method so it wouldn’t break if the book was already available. Finally, I asked why my Rating.average() test expected a result between 3.4 and 3.9 when my math gave me 4.0 — this helped me think about different ways averages can be calculated.
Overall, I mainly used AI for concept explanations and debugging hints

Week 5

This week I used AI mostly while working on my group’s Function Library Project. My part was focused on testing and reporting for our Universal Restaurant Inventory Management System. I used AI to help me plan out the five functions I was responsible for and to check that my code followed Python style rules.

I asked it to explain how to write clear docstrings and how to use datetime to handle expiration dates. That helped me finish functions like mark_expired_items() and generate_waste_report() correctly. When I ran into small bugs, I asked AI what might be wrong with my logic or why a value didn’t print the way I expected. It pointed me in the right direction, but I fixed the problems myself.

I also used AI for feedback on my AI Collaboration Journal to make sure it sounded clear and organized. Overall, AI helped me understand my code better and write it more neatly, but I still did all the main work and testing on my own.

week 6
This week I used AI mainly while completing my INST326 Week 6 Methods & Class Design notebook. Most of the work focused on building Python classes with instance, class, and static methods.
I asked AI to remind me how @classmethod and @staticmethod differ, and to show short examples so I could apply the same structure in my own code. I also used it for light debugging when a few of my methods weren’t returning the right values. For instance, it helped me see that my renewal () method needed to update the due date using timedelta, and that I had a missing return in one of my boolean checks.
AI was also helpful for reviewing date handling with the datetime module and clarifying when to use instance vs. class attributes. I made sure to write and test all the final solutions myself after understanding the explanations.
Here are some of the chats I used this week:

Overall, AI helped me understand object-oriented programming more clearly and fix small logic issues, but all the coding and testing in the notebook were completed on my own.

Week 7
This week I used AI a bit for debugging while working on the Week 7 exercises and the library system project. I wrote most of the code myself but ran into some issues with exception handling that I needed help sorting out.
I used ChatGPT mainly to debug my parse_copies() function and the assert_not_overdue() helper function for the Week 7 exercises. The parse_copies function was mostly working but I wanted to make sure my error handling was correct. For the assert_not_overdue function, I had written the basic logic but wasn't sure if I was handling the edge cases right - like what happens when a book is returned late versus just being overdue. ChatGPT helped me see that I needed to check both scenarios.
I also used AI to help write some unit tests for the exercises since I'm still getting the hang of the unittest framework. It showed me how to use assertRaises() properly which was helpful.
I didn't use AI to write any of the main code or the dataclasses for the library system - I did all that myself. Just used it to fix bugs and understand testing better.

Week 8
This week I used AI a couple times while working on the Week 8 inheritance stuff for INST326. Honestly, inheritance was kind of confusing at first so I needed some help understanding how it all works.
I asked AI to explain how parent and child classes connect and when you're supposed to use super(). That cleared up a lot for me because I kept forgetting to call the parent's init() method in my child classes. I also wasn't sure when to completely override a method versus just adding to it with super(), so I asked about that too.
The main thing I got stuck on was setting up the child class constructors properly. I kept getting errors because I wasn't initializing the parent class attributes correctly. AI gave me some examples that made sense and then I was able to fix my code.
I wrote all the actual code myself though. Just used AI when I hit a wall or didn't understand a concept. Inheritance is still a little weird to me but it makes more sense now than it did at the start of the week.

Week 9

This week I used AI mostly while finishing my Excel assignments and doing some debugging for my Python work in INST326. For Excel, I asked AI to help me organize my worksheets, fix formatting issues, and double-check some of the probability calculations so everything matched the instructor’s requirements. It didn’t do the assignment for me, but it helped me understand how to structure the file and clean up mistakes.

I also used AI for a few small Python questions, mainly when I got stuck on logic or return values. For example, I asked why one of my functions wasn’t returning the right output, and AI pointed out that I had a missing return statement. I also used it to walk me through how to write cleaner code when working step-by-step on the exercises.

Overall, AI helped me fix small errors and stay organized, but I still completed the actual Excel work and Python coding on my own.
